# Aware Predictive Analytics 

This was my senior project at Hofstra University. It was built to run on Centos 6/7. Aware is a big data analysis web application, built to mine social media data and make large scale predictions from this information. Applications for this range from market research, political candidate polling,  to predicting stock market fluctuations.  Aware is capable of scaling up to processing multiple terabytes of information a day. Aware was designed to run on a hadoop cluster. The distributed system that Hadoop provides allowed the entire collection/analysis process to be completely automated. 


The scripts are complete but will currently only work on the hadoop cluster I had at hofstra. I have not yet had the chance to modify them to work on any system. All the file paths that I used while on Hofstra's Big Data Lab are still there. Some of my draft scripts are still currently in there as well.
