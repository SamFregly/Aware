# Aware Predictive Analytics 

This was my senior project at Hofstra University. It was built to run on Centos 6/7. The necessary python libraries are only available for Centos 7 and at the start of this project the search algorithm TIPS was only useable on Centos 6. 


The scripts are complete but will currently only work on the hadoop cluster I had at hofstra. I have not yet had the chance to modify them to work on any system. All the file paths that I used while on Hofstra's Big Data Lab are still there. Some of my draft scripts are still currently in there as well. 


WARNING Rawdata.gz contains over 40gb of data. DO NOT OPEN UNLESS YOU HAVE THE SPACE. There are a few additional scripts in there that I need to pull out. 

The search algorithm called TIPS/seekit is not included due to copyright issues. This I personally have the rights to use it but not the rights to distribute it. 

The Retrievedata.py will not work until you sign up as a developer on Twitter and get your own authentication keys
